         <description>Addressing inherent uncertainty and exploiting structure are fundamental to turning data into knowledge. Statistical relational learning (SRL) builds on principles from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic to represent structure. In this talk I will overview our recent work on probabilistic soft logic (PSL), an SRL framework for collective, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains. PSL is able to reason holistically about both entity attributes and relationships among the entities, along with ontological constraints. The underlying mathematical framework supports extremely efficient inference. Our recent results show that by building on state-of-the-art optimization methods in a distributed implementation, we can solve large-scale knowledge graph extraction problems with millions of random variables orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.</description>

He was voted Top-5 Software Entrepreneur in Austria in 1991 and Person of the Year for the State of Salzburg in 2000. He has chaired the Rueschlikon Conference on Information Policy in the New Economy, bringing together leading strategists and decision-makers of the new economy. He is a frequent public speaker, and sought expert for print and broadcast media worldwide. He and his work have been featured in (among others) New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Economist, Nature, Science, NPR, BBC, The Guardian, Le Monde, El Pais, Die Zeit, Der Spiegel, WIRED, Ars Technica, and Daily Kos. He is also on the boards of foundations, think tanks and organizations focused on studying the information economy, and advises governments, businesses and NGOs on new economy and information society issues.</bio>

	     <description>Much has been made of "big data", our ability to gain novel insights from a comprehensive set of data points, but a lot of it is hype, and marketing-speak to sell more tools and consulting. In this talk, I will explain what Big Data really is, why it isn¹t just a marketing fad or the tool du jour, but a new way of making sense of the world around us, and consequently why Big Data matters a great deal, in particular also in the context of semantic technologies. But I will also mention why we need to be cautious and well aware of Big Data limitations when utilizing it.</description>

            <bio>Massimo Poesio is a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Rochester (USA) in 1994, and was a EPSRC Advanced Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh from 1994-2001, and a professor in Digital Humanities at the University of Trento.  He is a cognitive scientist with a particular focus on human language technology; his research interests include computational models of semantic interpretation, particularly anaphora resolution; the creation of large corpora of semantically annotated data, also using games-with-a-purpose (www.phrasedetectives.org); the study of conceptual knowledge using a combination of methods from human language technology and from neuroscience; and deception detection.</bio>

	     <uriID>3</uriID>
	     <description>Crowdsourcing is usually seen primarily as an inexpensive and quick way of creating large resources for a variety of Artificial Intelligence tasks. However, our work with Phrase Detectives, a game-with-a-purpose designed to collect data about anaphora, suggests that collecting large numbers of judgments about very large amounts of data also tells us a lot about the extent to which human subjects agree or disagree about the interpretation of such data. In the talk I will introduce Phrase Detectives and discuss our results and their implications.</description>

	       <description>The traditional world of relational databases and enterprise data warehouses is being challenged by growth in data volumes, the rise of unstructured and semi-structured data, and the desire to extract more valuable business insights in order to remain competitive: we are entering the world of 'big data.' Views differ as to what constitutes 'big data' but a pragmatic definition is 'when the size of the data itself becomes part of the IT challenge.'
Scale-out, commodity hardware-based solutions based on the map-reduce programming model for parallel processing on large hardware  are emerging to address these Big Data requirements that have challenged traditional technologies. Simultaneously, interest is growing in Linked Data and Open Data and governments and other organisations around the world are publishing data on the web, offering public access to huge data volumes in an interoperable and extensible way using semantic technology open standards.
The question naturally arises as to how these two emerging initiatives relate and this is the subject of the panel. Among the issues for discussion include:
 Linked Data and Big Data - how do they fit?
 Is reasoning over massive volumes of heterogeneous data feasible or desirable?
 Is consistency over massive volumes of heterogeneous data feasible or desirable?
 What representations are suitable for big data management?
 How can semantic technology be used in real-time environments with large volume data feeds?
 How big is big to qualify as Big Data and do traditional data mining techniques remain appropriate?
 What value can semantic technology bring to the concerns of Big Data?
 Is a new Theory of Data required and how can semantic technology contribute?
We have assembled a panel from a variety of backgrounds with wide-ranging expertise for what should be a lively and informative debate!</description>
