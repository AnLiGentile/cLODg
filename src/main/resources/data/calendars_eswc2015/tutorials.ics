SUMMARY:Tutorial full day tutorial: Mobile LD App
DESCRIPTION:How to develop mobile Linked Data apps in 10 mins! With the rapid advancement of mobile technologies, people are using their mobile devices as primary computing platforms and are generating and consuming vast amounts of data on them. However, the lack of Linked Data tools for these devices has left much of this data unstructured and unfit for reuse or integration with other datasets. In this paper, we present Punya, an open source platform that enables easy and rapid development of mobile Linked Data apps. The platform also enables app users to contribute linked data, as well as consume existing linked data sets, paving the path to a burgeoning linked data ecosystem.

SUMMARY:Tutorial half day tutorial: ELDSCID
DESCRIPTION:Tutorial on Enterprise Linked Data Strategies & the Commercialization of Interlinked Data (ELDSCID 2015). The adoption of Linked Data technologies in enterprises in order to improve methods of Data Integration and to introduce new approaches for a more efficient Information Management is becoming increasingly popular. This trend is complemented by activities aimed at commercializing Interlinked (Open) Data, mainly undertaken by publishers and media companies. While professional information providers work on Linked Data infrastructures to be able to deliver better linkable information assets on a more granular level, enterprises are in the process of redesigning information strategies and content workflows. Ultimate goals are heading towards a more efficient reuse and enrichment of knowledge assets and the personalisation of information services. In this tutorial, we will give several demos and concrete examples of how Linked Data can be used by enterprises in various industries. We will classify those to give a coherent picture over ‘typical application scenarios’ and corresponding benefits arguments. From an information provider’s perspective, we will discuss how Linked Data has become a game changer for the whole content industry. In addition, we will shed light on new business models for Linked Data at the intersection of Linked Data assets, stakeholders and revenue models by introducing the Linked Data Business Cube.

SUMMARY:Tutorial half day tutorial: Soc Med Gate
DESCRIPTION:Practical Annotation and Processing of Social Media with GATE. Social media is fast becoming a crucial part of our everyday lives, not only as a fun and practical way to share our interests and activities with geographically distributed networks of friends, but as an important part of our business lives also. Processing social media is particularly problematic for automated tools, because it is a strong departure from the tradition of newswire that many tools were developed with and evaluated against, and also due to the terse and low-context language it typically comprises. This tutorial will address these issues in the context of the semantic web by introducing some of the problems faced by using NLP tools on social media, and solutions to these problems, including those specifically implemented in GATE and recently made publicly available. It will demonstrate techniques for extracting the relevant information from unstructured text in social media, so that participants will be equipped with the necessary building blocks of knowledge to build their own tools and tackle complex issues. Since all of the NLP tools to be presented are open source, the tutorial will provide the attendees with skills which are easy to apply and do not require special software or licenses.

SUMMARY:Tutorial half day tutorial: LDP4j
DESCRIPTION:Building interoperable read-write Linked Data applications with the W3C Linked Data Platform and the LDP4j framework. The W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP) is an initiative to produce a standard protocol and a set of best practices for the development of read-write Linked Data applications. The LDP protocol provides clarifications on the use of the HTTP protocol in Linked Data applications, proposes several extensions in the context of Linked Data applications, and enforces further restrictions. As consequence, the LDP specification enables interoperable read-write Linked data applications based on HTTP access to web resources that describe their state using the RDF data model. The standardization of this protocol represents a step forward in the Linked Data community as it lays the ground for the development of interoperable read-write Linked Data applications. This tutorial provides an overview to the Linked Data Platform including resources, different types of containers, and other features such as paging, patching, etc., and discusses the different design considerations one should take into account when building read-write Linked Data applications. In addition to the theoretical background on the LDP specification and application design, the tutorial consists of a hands on session on how to build a read-write Linked Data application from scratch using LDP4j, an open source Java framework for developing LDP-enabled applications.

SUMMARY:Tutorial full day tutorial: Linked Geo
DESCRIPTION:Publishing and Interlinking Linked Geospatial Data. In this tutorial we present the life cycle of linked geospatial data and we focus on two important steps: the publication of geospatial data as RDF graphs and the discovery of spatial and temporal links between linked geospatial data. Given the proliferation of geospatial information on the Web many kinds of geospatial data are now becoming available as linked datasets (e.g., Google and Bing maps, user-generated geospatial content etc.). The topic of the tutorial is related to all core research areas of the Semantic Web (e.g., semantic information extraction, transformation of data into RDF graphs, interlinking linked data etc.) since there is often a need to re-consider existing core techniques when we deal with geospatial information. Thus, it is timely to train Semantic Web researchers, especially the ones that are in the early stages of their careers, on the state of the art of this area and invite them to contribute to it. In this tutorial we give a comprehensive background on data models, query languages, implemented systems for linked geospatial data, we discuss recent approaches on publishing geospatial data as RDF graphs and we discuss techniques for interlinking linked data by taking into account their spatial and temporal extent. The tutorial is complemented with a hands on session that will familiarize the audience with the state-of-the-art tools in publishing and interlinking geospatial information.

SUMMARY:Tutorial half day tutorial: VisLOD
DESCRIPTION:Visual Analytics with Linked Open Data and Social Media (VisLOD). The increasing availability of essential information as Linked Open Data has empowered ordinary citizens and organisations with means to increase their understanding of their political, social, economic and cultural environment. Social Media, on the other hand, offer means to share experiences, connect with friends/relatives, keep updated with situations and understand the public perception of events, places or individuals. With the availability of large datasets, a considerable challenge is how to quickly and efficiently consume such datasets. Visual Analytics solutions offer a promising direction of research for consuming large semantic datasets and quickly identify hidden trends, patterns and anomalies, obtain overviews of large data spaces and promptly reach data points of interest. The goal of the tutorial is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in visual and interactive techniques for exploring Social Media, Linked Open Data and Web Content. The hands-on tutorial will cover technical aspects from two perspectives: data collection and data analysis using Visualisation techniques. Data collection hand-on will include gathering (i) Social Media content, (ii) Linked Data and (iii) performing Information Extraction on Web content. The data analysis hands-on will introduce various open source visualisation tools and will cover design and implementation of web-based visual analytic solutions.

SUMMARY:Tutorial full day tutorial: SDA-SmartCity
DESCRIPTION:Semantics and Data Analytics for Smart City Applications (SDA-SmartCity). We are witnessing an era where advancements in networking, software and hardware technologies are enabling billions of smart devices and objects to be connected to the Internet. While the new technologies pave the way towards a new generation of smart city applications and services, the variation in modality, quality, formats and representations of smart city data are amongst the crucial issues that hinder effective use of the real world data collected by the sensory devices. Typically in a smart city framework, higher­level abstractions need to be created from real world data streams using data analytic methods for event processing and knowledge extraction purposes in a scalable way. Additionally, Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data play a key role in providing interoperability, association analysis, information and knowledge extractions, and reasoning about trust, privacy, provenance, and security in smart city frameworks. This tutorial will explore different processing steps for smart city data from data acquisition and semantic annotation to event processing, information extraction and pattern analysis in different smart city scenarios and using available cutting­ edge tools.
