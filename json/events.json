Statistical relational learning (SRL) builds on principles from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic to represent structure. In this talk I will overview our recent work on probabilistic soft logic (PSL), an SRL framework for collective, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains. PSL is able to reason holistically about both entity attributes and relationships among the entities, along with ontological constraints. The underlying mathematical framework supports extremely efficient inference. Our recent results show that by building on state-of-the-art optimization methods in a distributed implementation, we can solve large-scale knowledge graph extraction problems with millions of random variables orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.","createdAt":"","startsAt":"2015-06-03T09:30:00","endsAt":"2015-06-03T10:30:00","resource":null,"duration":"PT1H","lastModifiedAt":"","homepage":null,"twitterWidgetToken":"#ISWC2015","locations":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_1","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_2"],"parent":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/ld4ie\/2015","children":null,"topics":null,"categories":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/category\/keynote-event"],"roles":null,"papers":null},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/ld4ie\/2015\/keynote\/2","name":"Invited Talk: Viktor Mayer-Sch?nberger - Why Big Data Matters - a lot","description":"Much has been made of \"big data\", our ability to gain novel insights from a comprehensive set of data points, but a lot of it is hype, and marketing-speak to sell more tools and consulting. In this talk, I will explain what Big Data really is, why it isn?t just a marketing fad or the tool du jour, but a new way of making sense of the world around us, and consequently why Big Data matters a great deal, in particular also in the context of semantic technologies. But I will also mention why we need to be cautious and well aware of Big Data limitations when utilizing it.","createdAt":"","startsAt":"2015-06-02T09:30:00","endsAt":"2015-06-02T10:30:00","resource":null,"duration":"PT1H","lastModifiedAt":"","homepage":null,"twitterWidgetToken":"#ISWC2015","locations":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_1","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_2"],"parent":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/ld4ie\/2015","children":null,"topics":null,"categories":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/category\/keynote-event"],"roles":null,"papers":null},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/ld4ie\/2015\/keynote\/3","name":" Invited Talk: Massimo Poesio - What Crowdsourcing Tells Us about Cognition: the Case of Anaphora","description":"Crowdsourcing is usually seen primarily as an inexpensive and quick way of creating large resources for a variety of Artificial Intelligence tasks. However, our work with Phrase Detectives, a game-with-a-purpose designed to collect data about anaphora, suggests that collecting large numbers of judgments about very large amounts of data also tells us a lot about the extent to which human subjects agree or disagree about the interpretation of such data. In the talk I will introduce Phrase Detectives and discuss our results and their implications.","createdAt":"","startsAt":"2015-06-04T11:30:00","endsAt":"2015-06-04T12:30:00","resource":null,"duration":"PT1H","lastModifiedAt":"","homepage":null,"twitterWidgetToken":"#ISWC2015","locations":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_1","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/location\/EMERALD_2"],"parent":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/ld4ie\/2015","children":null,"topics":null,"categories":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/category\/keynote-event"],"roles":null,"papers":null}]}
